/*
 * Chrome renders extra-wide &nbsp; characters for the Hoefler Text font.
 * This results in a jumping cursor when typing in both the Classic and block
 * editors. The following font-face override fixes the issue by manually inserting
 * a custom font that includes just a Hoefler Text space replacement for that
 * character instead.
 * If we add the border using a regular CSS border, it won't look good on non-retina devices,
 * since its edges can look jagged due to lack of antialiasing. In this case, we are several
 * layers of box-shadow to add the border visually, which will render the border smoother. */

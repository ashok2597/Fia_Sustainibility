TODO 5 Please review if the Javascript files under the folder 'js' are needed. These were in the theme WebOccult provided. If this is not needed I believe we should remove it,
otherwise if this is needed we should migrate this to the UI / Home controller (as mentioned in point number 3)

TODO 6 Please review if folders 'include', 'inc' and 'classes' with php files are needed. If not please remove it
